#  Musica
Music and videos? Both in this application.

### Project description
This is an app that'll be able to play both music and videos. This application will use  YouTube API, or other musics API.

Note: this is my first time of making apps like this, so this application making may take longer than usual. 

### Libraries
- <b>SDWebImage</b> for image related ( album cover ).
- <b>Firebase</b> for user authentication.
- <b>Realm</b> for database.
- <b>Alamofire</b> *** I don't know if I'm gonna use it or not, but I think I'll give it a go.
